# Alpha Vantage Test Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created for [https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/).

## Functions âš¡

- **Core Stock APIs:** This suite of APIs provide global equity data in 4 different temporal resolutions: (1) daily, (2) weekly, (3) monthly, and (4) intraday, with 20+ years of historical depth. A lightweight ticker quote endpoint and several utility functions such as ticker search and market open/closure status are also included for your convenience.
- **Alpha Intelligenceâ„¢:** The APIs in this section contain advanced market intelligence built with our decades of expertise in AI, machine learning, and quantitative finance. We hope these highly differentiated alternative datasets can help turbocharge your trading strategy, market research, and financial software application to the next level.
- **Economic Indicators:** APIs under this section provide key US economic indicators frequently used for investment strategy formulation and application development.
- **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicator APIs for a given equity or currency exchange pair, derived from the underlying time series based stock API and forex data. All indicators are calculated from adjusted time series data to eliminate artificial price/volume perturbations from historical split and dividend events.
